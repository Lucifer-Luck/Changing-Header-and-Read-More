                        After eight films that have amassed almost $5 billion worldwide, the
                        Fast & Furious franchise now features its first stand-alone fan base as
                        Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham reprise their roles as Luke Hobbs and
                        Deckard Shaw in Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw. Ever since
                        hulking lawman Hobbs, a loyal agent of America's Diplomatic Security
                        Service, and lawless outcast Shaw, a former British military elite
                        operative, first faced off in 2015's Furious 7, the duo have swapped
                        smack talk and body blows as they've tried to take each other down.
                        But when cyber-genetically enhanced anarchist Brixton Lore (Idris Elba)
                        gains control of an insidious bio-threat that could alter humanity
                        forever — and bests a brilliant and fearless rogue MI6 agent
                        (The Crown’s Vanessa Kirby), who just happens to be Shaw's sister — these
                        two sworn enemies will have to partner up to bring down the only guy who
                        might be badder than themselves. Hobbs & Shaw blasts open a new door in
                        the Fast universe as it hurtles action across the globe, from Los Angeles
                        to London and from the toxic wasteland of Chernobyl to the lush beauty of
                        Samoa.

                        In London, Hattie Shaw and her team of MI6 agents attempt to retrieve a
                        programmable supervirus dubbed "Snowflake" from terrorist organization
                        Eteon. Brixton Lore, an Eteon operative with cybernetic implants that
                        allow him to perform superhuman feats, arrives and kills all the agents
                        except Hattie, who injects Snowflake into herself before escaping.
                        Brixton frames Hattie for killing her team and stealing Snowflake,
                        forcing her to go on the run.

                            Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw are both informed of the missing virus and
                            are reluctantly assigned to work together to track it down. After a
                            brief meeting at a CIA black site at Leadenhall Building, Deckard goes
                            to Hattie's house for information, while Hobbs manages to find Hattie;
                            after a brief scuffle, he brings her to the CIA office, as Deckard then
                            returns. The office is attacked, and Hattie, whom Deckard reveals is his
                            sister, is taken by Brixton, whom Deckard recognizes as an old
                            colleague-turned-enemy he'd previously shot and supposedly killed.
                            Hobbs and Deckard pursue and rescue Hattie during an ensuing car chase,
                            managing to escape from Brixton, who crashes into a double-decker bus.
                            However, Brixton frames all three as traitors via Eteon's control of
                            global news media.
                        </p>

                            The three locate Professor Andreiko, who created Snowflake to
                            efficiently deliver vaccines, who informs them that to prevent Eteon
                            from using Snowflake to eradicate humanity, Hattie, while the virus is
                            still dormant, must either be cremated or have the virus removed with a
                            specialized extraction device, located in Eteon's headquarters in
                            Chernobyl, Ukraine. After flying undercover to Moscow and rendezvousing
                            with Deckard's girlfriend Margarita to rearm, the three infiltrate the
                            facility. They manage to retrieve the extraction device before escaping
                            and destroying the facility; however, Andreiko is killed, and the device
                            is damaged during their escape.

                        <p>
                            Hobbs takes the trio to his childhood home in Samoa to visit his
                            estranged brother Jonah, a talented mechanic, to repair the device and
                            lay low before confronting Brixton again. Hobbs has a tense reunion with
                            his family, but Jonah is eventually persuaded to help them by their
                            mother. The makeshift battalion prepares for Eteon's arrival, setting up
                            a variety of traps around the island. Jonah successfully repairs the
                            device and starts the virus extraction, just as Brixton and his army
                            arrive. In the ensuing battle, all of Brixton's soldiers are defeated.
                            Brixton retakes Hattie via helicopter; however, Hobbs, Deckard, and the
                            Samoans bring the aircraft down. Working together, Hobbs and Deckard
                            defeat Brixton, who is remotely terminated afterward by Eteon's
                            never-seen director. The director send a message claiming to know
                            Hobbs and intending to persuade him and the Shaw siblings, while they
                            promise to find the director. The group celebrates their victory.
                        </p>
                            
                        <p>
                            In mid and post-credits scenes, Hobbs brings his daughter to meet their
                            extended family in Samoa; Deckard and Hattie are implied to bust their
                            mother out of prison; and Hobbs receives a call from his partner, Locke,
                            informing him that he had broken into a facility and discovered another
                            virus worse than the Snowflake virus.

                        <p>
                            Hobbs also secretly has the London police set on Deckard in retaliation
                            for a prank during the trip to Moscow.
